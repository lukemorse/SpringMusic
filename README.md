# SpringMusic

Spring Music is my Master's Thesis composition, which explores the sonic possibilities of a simple wooden box with nails and springs attached. I wrote a program to reassemble the sounds according to spectral readings at percussive onsets. These spectral characteristics include spectral centroid which corresponds to how "bright" a sound is, and spectral flatness which describes the perceived "noisiness" of a sound. Thus, a vague linearity can be heard in the streams of notes as they are ordered from brightest to least bright, noisiest to clearest prevalence of pitch, etc.
